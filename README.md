# Terraform - Homework 1

## Part I

* **concat** - takes two or more lists and combines them into a single list.
* **format** - produces a string by formatting a number of other values according to a specification string. It is similar to the printf function in C, and other similar functions in other programming languages.
* **merge** - takes an arbitrary number of maps or objects, and returns a single map or object that contains a merged set of elements from all arguments. If more than one given map or object defines the same key or attribute, then the one that is later in the argument sequence takes precedence. If the argument types do not match, the resulting type will be an object matching the type structure of the attributes after the merging rules have been applied.
